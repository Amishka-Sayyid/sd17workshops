# React: Components

**Workshop**
A component is a reusable piece of a user interface. Itâ€™s a way of encapsulating together the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up a single piece of functionality. Components can be composed together to create larger components, and then an entire application.

A component name always begins with a capital letter. It works the same way a function does, with logic and arguments (props), but also returns a block of HTML:

    function MyComponent() {
    return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
    }
