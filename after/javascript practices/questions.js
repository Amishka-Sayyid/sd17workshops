/*Practice Problems:
Here are a few fun and challenging problems you can try:

Most Frequent Character (Variant):

Modify the original problem to return both the most frequent character and its count. You can return the result as an object, like { char: 'B', count: 3 }.
Character Frequency in an Array of Strings:

Given an array of strings, count the frequency of each character across all strings in the array.
Anagram Checker:

Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., they contain the same characters in any order).
Find the Second Most Frequent Character:

After finding the most frequent character, modify the function to find the second most frequent character in the string.
Palindrome Check:

Write a function that checks whether a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Group Anagrams:

Given an array of strings, group them into an array of anagram groups.*/
